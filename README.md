# HoloCureMath

Solving HoloCure equations with computer vision. 

## Quickstart

1. Download the executable under [Releases](https://github.com/rencas-syk/HoloCureMath/releases).
2. Start the application: a small window will appear.
3. Start the math minigame at the Usada Casino
4. The window will display the solution

## Known Issues

- Only supports 1920x1080 and 1280x720 resolutions
- With the changed font for mathematical operators came some inconsistencies when applying opencv template matching. While most have been accounted for, some equations may still be identified incorrectly.

## Planned Improvements

- Add support for all resolutions
- Add overlay option to display the solution over "???" (90% done)
- Integration into more comprehensive automation interface (soon<sup>TM</sup>)
