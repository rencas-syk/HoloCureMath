# HoloCureMath

Solving HoloCure equations with computer vision. 

## Quickstart

1. Download the executable under [Releases](https://github.com/rencas-syk/HoloCureMath/releases).
2. Start the application: a small window will appear.
3. Start the math minigame at the Usada Casino
4. The window will display the solution

## Known Issues

With the changed font for mathematical operators came some inconsistencies when applying opencv template matching, resulting in unsolvable. While most have been accounted for, some equations may still be identified incorrectly.

## Planned Improvements

- Add overlay option to display the solution over "???" (90% done)
- Integration into more comprehensive automation interface (soon<sup>TM</sup>)
